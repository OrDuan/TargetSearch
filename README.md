# TargetSearch
[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/targetsearch/nohmjponpgbnhjokbmagdbnjpnmdaigb) that makes the gray lines in the search result linkable so you can auto scroll to the text.

**Please note that the extension will not work 100% of the time since google does some fuzzing, caching and cut some of the sentences.**

## How Does It Work?
The paragraph in the search result is replaced with linkable paragraph. 
When the user click on a link, the extension will save the key word and will try to search for them in the page that opened that it will scroll the view into the paragraph.
